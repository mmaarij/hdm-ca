/**
 * Permission Schema
 *
 * This file is reserved for Effect Schema validators if needed in the future.
 * Currently, we use TypeScript types for compile-time validation and
 * entity factory functions for runtime construction.
 *
 * Domain validation happens through:
 * - Entity factory functions (DocumentPermission.create, DocumentPermission.updatePermission)
 * - Domain guards (in guards.ts)
 * - Value objects with branded types
